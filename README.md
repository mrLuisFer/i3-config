# i3-config

## Setup
First of all, you need to install **i3wm** and **i3status**\
You can read the official documentation on how to install it

- [i3wm.org](https://i3wm.org/)
- [i3wm.org/downloads](https://i3wm.org/downloads/)
- [i3status.org](https://i3wm.org/docs/i3status.html)

Some of the commands you can run are the following:

If you use a system that uses pacman or yay like me, you can run the following
**Arch**
```
yay -S i3wm i3status
```

Once installed you can clone the repository at the following path: (`~/.config/i3`)
```
mkdir ~/.config/i3 && cd ~/.config/i3 
```

And execute:
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/mrLuisFer/i3-config.git .
```
