# i3wm Basic Config for Linux

## Setup
First of all, you need to install **i3wm** and **i3status**\
You can read the official documentation on how to install it

- [i3wm.org](https://i3wm.org/)
- [i3wm.org/downloads](https://i3wm.org/downloads/)
- [i3status.org](https://i3wm.org/docs/i3status.html)

Some of the commands you can run are the following:

If you use a system that uses `pacman` or `yay` like me, you can run the following command
```
yay -S i3wm i3status
```

Once installed you can clone the repository at the following path: (`~/.config/i3`)
```
mkdir ~/.config/i3 && cd ~/.config/i3
```

And execute:
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/mrLuisFer/i3-config.git .
```

Now **log out** or **restart** to be able to change the window manager

it is highly recommended to have a **Nerd Font** installed this in order to have a better appearance and a good font style\
You can install one by one in the following link

- [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

Or look for the command to install all (approximately +1gb)\
For example:
```
yay -S nerd-fonts-complete
```
